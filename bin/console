# NOTE
#######################
# ActiveJob must be included into any and all jobs that you want to either make acidic or enqueue acidicly.
# We recommend that you `include AcidicJob` in your `ApplicationJob`

# You can add fixtures and/or initialization code here to make experimenting
# with your gem easier. You can also use a different console, if you like.

# (If you use this, don't forget to add pry to your Gemfile!)
# require "pry"
# Pry.start
